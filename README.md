This app demos DAO design pattern. 
DAO sits between db and the java app. 
The app fetches, manipulates data in the database using methods such as: CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE, READALL. 
These functions are writtern in the DAO file. Then it either returns an object or makes some changes on the DB. 
These functions are called from the service layer. 
Model layer contains the POJO classes such as Patient, Doctor, Appointment
